## üîÑ Issue Closure Pattern

### Closure Message Template

For **inactive issues** (no activity for 60+ days):

```
Closing due to inactivity ([X] days). [Brief context about the issue]. Please reopen if still relevant. üå∏
```

**Examples:**
- `Closing due to inactivity (156 days). Mentatbot configuration is external to Pollinations. üå∏`
- `Closing due to inactivity (82 days). Special bee request with no recent activity. Please reopen if still relevant. üå∏`
- `Closing due to inactivity (250 days). No description provided. Please reopen with details if still relevant. üå∏`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issue: Body Overwriting

**Problem:** When closing issues, GitHub's API overwrites the original issue body with the closure message.

**Solution:** Use the restoration script to recover original content from edit history.

---

## üêù Special Bee Request Review Process

### Step 1: Identify Candidates

Search for special bee requests closed recently:
```bash
gh issue list --label special-bee-request --state closed --limit 50
```

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Request

**Strong Candidates Have:**
- ‚úÖ Active GitHub repository with code
- ‚úÖ Working live demo or deployed product
- ‚úÖ Clear documentation of Pollinations integration
- ‚úÖ Practical use case that benefits community
- ‚úÖ Recent commits or active maintenance

**Weak Candidates Have:**
- ‚ùå No GitHub repository provided
- ‚ùå No live demo or product
- ‚ùå Personal/private project with no public benefit
- ‚ùå Incomplete or vague description
- ‚ùå No evidence of Pollinations integration

### Step 3: Restore Issue Bodies (if needed)

If the original description was overwritten during closure:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token node restore-issue-bodies.js <issue-number> --apply
```

### Step 4: Grant Tier (if approved)

```bash
cd /path/to/auth.pollinations.ai
node scripts/set-tier.js <github-user-id> flower
```

The script automatically uses `--remote` flag for production database.

### Step 5: Notify User

Add a comment to the issue:

```markdown
üå∏ **Flower Tier Granted!**

@username Your [project name] is exactly the kind of project we love to support! [Brief praise about what makes it special]

We've upgraded your account to **flower tier** to help you [benefit].

**What you get:**
- Higher rate limits for API requests
- Priority queue access
- [Other specific benefits]

Get your API token at https://auth.pollinations.ai and keep building! üöÄ

Your app is live at: [project URL]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Essential Scripts

### 1. restore-issue-bodies.js

**Purpose:** Restore original issue descriptions that were overwritten during closure

**Location:** `/repo-cleanup-2025/restore-issue-bodies.js`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Test mode (dry run)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token node restore-issue-bodies.js <issue-number>

# Apply changes
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token node restore-issue-bodies.js <issue-number> --apply

# Multiple issues
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token node restore-issue-bodies.js 3310 3315 3084 --apply
```

**How it works:**
1. Fetches issue edit history via GitHub GraphQL API
2. Finds the edit by voodoohop (closure message)
3. Extracts the previous edit (original content)
4. Restores original body
5. Preserves closure message as a comment
6. Adds explanation about restoration

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Skips already-restored issues
- ‚úÖ Handles missing/empty original bodies gracefully
- ‚úÖ Preserves closure context as comments
- ‚úÖ Adds restoration explanation

### 2. set-tier.js

**Purpose:** Set user tier in auth.pollinations.ai database

**Location:** `/auth.pollinations.ai/scripts/set-tier.js`

**Usage:**
```bash
cd /path/to/auth.pollinations.ai
node scripts/set-tier.js <github-user-id> <tier>
```

**Tiers:** `seed`, `flower`, `nectar`

**Features:**
- Automatically uses `--remote` flag (production database)
- Creates user_tiers table if needed
- Verifies tier after setting
- Shows confirmation with timestamp

## üîß Restoration Process

### When to Restore

Restore issue bodies when:
1. Original description was overwritten with closure message
2. Issue needs review for tier grant consideration
3. Historical context is important

### Restoration Workflow

```bash
# 1. Identify issues needing restoration
# Look for issues where body = closure message

# 2. Run restoration script
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token node restore-issue-bodies.js <issue-number> --apply

# 3. Verify restoration
# Check issue on GitHub - body should show original content
# Closure message should be preserved as comment

# 4. Review and decide on tier grant
# Now you can see the full original request
```

### Success Metrics

From 2025-09-30 session:
- **Successfully Restored:** 35 issues
- **Failed/Not Found:** 24 (mostly PRs or deleted issues)
- **Success Rate:** ~60% (expected, as some issues are PRs or have deleted content)

---

## üí° Key Learnings

### 1. GitHub API Edit History

**Discovery:** The `diff` field in GitHub's edit history contains the **entire content** at that point in time, not a unified diff.

**Implication:** The second-to-last edit contains the full original body before closure.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Get edits via GraphQL
const edits = issue.userContentEdits.nodes;

// Find our closure edit
const ourEdit = edits.find(e => e.editor?.login === 'voodoohop');

// Get previous edit (original content)
const originalEdit = edits[edits.indexOf(ourEdit) + 1];
const originalBody = originalEdit.diff; // Full original content
```

### 2. Duplicate Comment Prevention

**Problem:** Running restoration script multiple times creates duplicate comments.

**Solution:** Check for existing restoration before proceeding:
```javascript
if (currentBody !== closureMessage) {
  console.log('Already restored, skipping...');
  return;
}
```

### 3. Tier Grant Decision Framework

**Key Questions:**
1. Does it have a public GitHub repo? (If no ‚Üí likely reject)
2. Is there a working live demo? (If no ‚Üí likely reject)
3. Does it benefit others beyond the creator? (If no ‚Üí likely reject)
4. Is the project actively maintained? (If no ‚Üí consider carefully)
5. Does it showcase Pollinations capabilities? (If yes ‚Üí strong candidate)

**Red Flags:**
- "I don't have money" (student assignments)
- "Personal project" without public benefit
- No repo, no demo, no details
- Deleted their own content

### 4. Communication Best Practices

**When Granting Tier:**
- ‚úÖ Be enthusiastic and supportive
- ‚úÖ Explain what they get with the tier
- ‚úÖ Link to their project to show you reviewed it
- ‚úÖ Include auth.pollinations.ai link for token

**When Closing Without Grant:**
- ‚úÖ Be brief and factual
- ‚úÖ Provide clear reason (inactivity, no details, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Invite reopening if circumstances change
- ‚úÖ Always end with üå∏

### 5. Batch Processing Efficiency

**Optimal Workflow:**
1. Close all issues in one batch (faster)
2. Review closure list for tier candidates
3. Restore bodies as needed
4. Grant tiers in batch
5. Add comments to notify users

**Time Savings:**
- Closing 25 issues: ~10 minutes
- Reviewing for candidates: ~20 minutes
- Restoring + granting tiers: ~15 minutes
- **Total:** ~45 minutes for 25 issues

## üå∏ Pollinations Philosophy

**Remember:** We're supporting indie developers and vibe-coders who make AI accessible to everyone. Be generous but thoughtful. Look for projects that:

- Make Pollinations more accessible
- Serve underserved communities
- Demonstrate creativity and innovation
- Have potential for community impact

**When in doubt:** Err on the side of supporting creators who are building in public and sharing their work.
