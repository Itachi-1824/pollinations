        question: "What is Pollen?",
        answer: "Pollen is the prepaid credit that powers the Pollinations backend. $1 = 1 Pollen (beta). Every API call is metered in Pollen; free models meter at 0 for unified telemetry.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I get Pollen (as a developer)?",
        answer: "Two ways:\n• Purchase packs — added to your wallet; do not expire\n• Sponsorship coupons — grant temporary Pollen; spent first; expire 24h after redemption",
    },
    {
        question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        answer: "Credit cards only for now. We'll be expanding payment options later.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is there a monthly subscription option?",
        answer: "Not yet but we are thinking about this for future iterations. Join our newsletter for updates on availability.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I try the API without an account or buying Pollen?",
        answer: "Yes. Use zero-registration trial endpoints and a limited set of free models. These calls do not consume Pollen. For more flexibily consider redeeming sponsorship coupons."
    },
    {
        question: "What changes when a user registers?",
        answer: "They keep access to the free models (rate‑limited) and unlock the paid model catalog (runs on Pollen, no platform rate limits). They also become eligible for daily grants.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do daily grants work?",
        answer: "Registered users receive sponsored Pollen every day at 00:00. Grants are spent before any purchased balance.\n\n• Seed (default): 1 Pollen/day\n• Flower (request in dashboard): 5 Pollen/day\n• Nectar (requires Flower; request in dashboard): 10 Pollen/day",
    },
    {
        question: "How is pricing set?",
        answer: "Platform‑defined. Pollinations publishes Pollen pricing per model/operation (Unified Price Surface).",
    },
    {
        question: "How much does each model cost in Pollen?",
        answer: "View real-time pricing in your dashboard or at our pricing page. Costs vary by model complexity.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do free models consume Pollen?",
        answer: "No. They are sponsored and controlled via rate limits.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will free models always stay free?",
        answer: "Yes! Free models remain free forever for all users. Paid options only apply to premium models that offer additional capabilities.",
    },
    {
        question: "How does the developer wallet work?",
        answer: "One wallet funds all your apps. Manage balance and top up at any time.",
    },
    {
        question: "What's next? (non‑binding)",
        answer: "• End‑user in‑app purchases (early 2026): integrate the Login & Top‑up Widget so end-users can buy Pollen inside your app. Each purchase granting bonus Pollen to the app owner.\n• More models: video and real‑time audio; expansion of the model catalog.\n• Ads plugin (2026): earn Pollen based on ad performance.",
